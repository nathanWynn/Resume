\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,} 
 
\noindent My name is Nathan Wynn; I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Georgia with a minor in Spanish. I am interested in applying for the Summer 2018 M3 .NET Intern position.

%of work you are applying for and identify source from  which  you

%newspaper, employment service, personal contact). 
 
\noindent Some of my greatest passions in life are building things that fill a need and helping others achieve their potential, which is why I believe I would provide unique benefit to M3. I am pursuing software engineering as a career because of the enormous potential for technology to be a driving force for change and source of improvement for people's daily lives. I have experience in mobile development from my own personal projects, and am fluent in C++, Java, Python, and C$\#$, as mentioned on my resume. In addition to having strong technical competency, I also place a high importance on communication and interpersonal skills. My previous experience as a strategic product management intern at Turner Broadcasting System has given me greater strategic thinking skills, as well as presentation, public speaking, research, and written communication skills that give me unique opportunities to provide benefit for M3.

%the company, its products, services - above all, stress what  you 
%can  do  for  the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain

%the  position.  If  you have practical work experience, point out 
%specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat 
%the  same  information  the reader will find in the resume. Refer 
%the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes 
%your  qualifications,  training,  and experiences. The purpose of 
%this section is to strengthen your resume  by  providing  details 
%which bring your experiences to life. 
 
\noindent 
%I would love to request a personal interview with you if you believe that I would be a good fit for this position. 
My phone number is (762) 436-9384, and you can also reach me at my email address: nww15119@uga.edu. If you would like any further information, please feel free to call or email me. Thank you for taking the time to review my application.
%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and  indicate  your
